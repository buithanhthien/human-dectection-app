I am now having a problem when launch launch_sim.launch.py:

```
(.venv) thien@thien-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-7th:~/human_detection_app$ ros2 launch node_pkg launch_sim.launch.py
[INFO] [launch]: All log files can be found below /home/thien/.ros/log/2026-02-19-16-43-50-561333-thien-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-7th-4922
[INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO
[ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): No module named 'nav2_common'
```

Could you troubleshoot the problem and fix it?
